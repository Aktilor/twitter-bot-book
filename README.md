# üìö Book of the Day Twitter Bot

## About
This Twitter bot recommends a random book every day based on the "word of the day." It retrieves a book recommendation from the Open Library API and posts a tweet with the book's title, author, publication date, number of pages, description, and cover image (if available). The bot uses the `twit` library to interact with the Twitter API.

## Requirements
- üì¶ Node.js (version 14 or higher recommended)
- üê¶ Twitter Developer account with Elevated access (Thank you Elon üôÉ) and API keys
- üíé RapidAPI free account

1. Clone this repository to your local machine

```

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command
